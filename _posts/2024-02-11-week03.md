title: Week 3 - Firefox Add-On Project

Comment on the git exercises we did in class. Comment on the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions)

This week we're creating an open source firefox add-on, this not only means the license is public (MIT license) but also we provide guidance to others on how they can contribute to our project.

The most surprising thing about this project was how simple and streamlined was the extension creation project is. I think mozilla really provides us a simple way to interact with the browser so we can focus on actually building the extension and not on plumbing.

This encourages me to actually play with this more and instead of trying to make do with certain extension, simply create my own that does exactly what I want, and release it as free software in case others have the same problem. This essentially opens up a whole new world of customizability for the Firefox browser for me.
