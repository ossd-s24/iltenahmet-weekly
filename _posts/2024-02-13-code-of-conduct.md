title: A Very Nice Code of Conduct Document

I've found a very well written code of conduct document recently. It's so elequently organized and detailed that I've wanted to share it.

Here's the link for it: [github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
