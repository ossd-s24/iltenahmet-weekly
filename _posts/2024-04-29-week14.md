## Open Source And ...

It was interesting to participate in the discussion about open source projects that wasn't necessarily software. One project that piqued my interest was open source sports, the project where they define rules for sports. However, I realized that some of the rules they put up for soccer was incorrect, I opened an issue about it. Also, I've found various open source recipe projects to be interesting, these could be a good way of keeping the information available, leveling the playing field between small businesses who like to make their own cola, or beer, and big corporations who'd like keep their recipes secret.

## Our Group Progress

This week, we've prepared our presentation about our project and progress. I've had a bit of time to reflect on this semster, and the project we've chosen. I'm very happy that we've found avenues of contributions that was welcoming and suitable to new contributors, and I'm very happy to be a part of the Godot community, and their ecosystem of game dev related tools and projects. I've been wanting to get into Godot more ever since I started making games but I haven't been able to since most projects I've worked on used different technologies, moving forward, with having more familiarity with Godot, I intend to stay a part of this community and eventually contributing to more complex and challenging parts of the engine.
